    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>The piano is a keyboard instrument in which hammers strike strings to produce sound. It has 88 keys, consisting of both white and black keys, which allow for a wide range of musical expression. The piano is known for its dynamic range and ability to produce both soft and powerful sounds, making it one of the most versatile instruments in the world.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The piano was invented in the early 1700s by Bartolomeo Cristofori, an Italian instrument maker. It was developed as an improvement over the harpsichord, allowing players to control volume by varying the pressure applied to the keys. Over time, the piano underwent significant modifications, leading to the modern grand and upright pianos used today. During the Classical and Romantic periods, composers like Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin contributed significantly to the instrument's repertoire, cementing its place in classical music.</p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <p>The piano is played by pressing keys with the fingers, causing hammers inside the instrument to strike strings and produce sound. The sustain and soft pedals allow for further control over the notes, enhancing musical expression. Piano players use both hands to play melodies, harmonies, and complex compositions. Learning to read sheet music is a fundamental skill for mastering the piano.</p>

    <h2>Genres</h2>
    <p>The piano is used in a wide range of musical genres, including classical, jazz, blues, pop, rock, and even electronic music. Classical music heavily relies on the piano for solo performances and orchestral compositions, while jazz and blues use it for improvisation and rhythm accompaniment. In modern pop and rock music, the piano is often used as a foundational instrument for songwriting and performances.</p>
