    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>The guitar is a popular string instrument that produces sound through the vibration of its strings when plucked or strummed. It typically has six strings and is available in acoustic, electric, and classical variations. The guitar is known for its versatility and is widely used in solo performances as well as in ensemble settings.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The guitar's origins can be traced back over 4,000 years to ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations, where early forms of plucked string instruments existed. The modern guitar evolved from instruments such as the lute and the vihuela during the Renaissance period. By the 19th century, the classical guitar, with its six-string design, became standard. In the 20th century, the invention of the electric guitar revolutionized music, leading to its dominance in rock, blues, and jazz.</p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <p>To play the guitar, musicians use one hand to press down on the frets along the neck, while the other hand plucks or strums the strings using fingers or a pick. Chords, scales, and melodies can be played using different techniques, such as fingerpicking, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and bends. The guitar can be played in a variety of tunings, with standard tuning (EADGBE) being the most common.</p>

    <h2>Genres</h2>
    <p>The guitar is a fundamental instrument in many music genres, including rock, blues, jazz, classical, flamenco, and pop. Acoustic guitars are commonly used in folk and country music, while electric guitars are essential in rock, metal, and jazz fusion. Classical guitars are often used in traditional Spanish and Latin music.</p>
