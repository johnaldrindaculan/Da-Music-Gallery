    <h2>Definition</h2>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <p>Cellists produce sound by using a bow drawn across the strings or by plucking them. The left hand manipulates the fingerboard to change pitch, while the right hand controls dynamics and articulation.</p>

    <h2>Genres</h2>
    <p>The cello is widely used in classical music, film scores, folk music, and even rock and pop. It provides deep harmonic support in orchestras and is also featured as a solo instrument.</p>
